      <p className="about-text">
        The Veil has shattered. The Covenant lies in ruins. Rise, Wanderer. Take
        up the ancient mantle, embrace the forgotten secrets of Covenant, and
        shape your destiny in a land torn asunder. The Covenant, once the proud
        heart of Aetheris under the radiant rule of the Old Empire, is now
        fractured and divided. The Great Sundering splintered its lands, twisted
        its magic, and plunged its people into an age of turmoil. Now,
        fragmented factions struggle for survival—each seeking to reclaim lost
        glory or carve a new future from the ashes of the past. Once
        interconnected by the Celestial Gates, the lands of Covenant are now
        isolated and fraught with untold dangers. Scholars, warriors, and
        visionaries seek the lost relics of the Old Empire—remnants of a golden
        era when knowledge was the key to power, and ambition knew no limits.
        The echoes of that age linger still, hidden in the ruins and shattered
        realms secrets waiting to be unearthed by those with the courage to
        claim them. Now, rise. Seek the remnants of the past, forge alliances or
        revel in conquest, and navigate a fragile land teetering between rebirth
        and annihilation. Walk the path of the Luminaries, the Ironclad Legion,
        or the Verdant Clans—the choice is yours. Shape the fate of the
        Covenant, heal its fractured lands, and confront the chaos that emerges.
        Will you rebuild? Will you conquer? Or will you be consumed by the
        shadows of what once was? Claim your destiny in Heyday: Rise of Empires.
        The Covenant awaits your rise to power.
